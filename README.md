# njspc-mqtt-broker - Version 0.9.1

## What is njspc-mqtt-broker?
njspc-mqtt-broker is an application or middleware that sits between the awesome nodejs-poolcontroller v6.X and an MQTT server allowing any Home Automation platform that integrates with MQTT to communicate with a supported Pentair pool controller. Both sensors (read-only) and states (read-write) are supported.

## Prerequisites
* Pentair Pool Controller supported by [nodejs-poolcontroller v6.X](https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController)
* Functional nodejs-poolcontroller v6.X installation which is properly communicating to your supported Pool Controller
* Functional MQTT server up and running such as [Eclipse Mosquittoâ„¢](https://mosquitto.org/download/)
* And of course, a Home Automation platform such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) so you can automate something!

## Installation Instructions

If you don't know anything about NodeJS, these directions might be helpful.

1. Install Nodejs (v12 recommended). (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Update NPM (https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
3. Download the latest [code release](https://github.com/kkzonie/njspc-mqtt-broker/releases)
   OR
   clone with `git clone git@github.com:kkzonie/njspc-mqtt-broker.git`
4. Unzip into njspc-mqtt-broker.
5. Run 'npm install' in the new folder (where package.json exists).  This will automatically install all the dependencies (mqtt, axios, sockets.io, etc.).
6. Edit the /config/config.json to meet your requirements for connecting to your MQTT server and your nodejs-poolcontroller installation.

* `{`
* &nbsp;&nbsp;`"mqtt": {`
* &nbsp;&nbsp;`"ip": "127.0.0.1",` <-- change to your MQTT server IP
* &nbsp;&nbsp;`"port": "1883",` <-- change to your MQTT server Port
* &nbsp;&nbsp;`"userName": "user123",` <-- change to your MQTT server User Name
* &nbsp;&nbsp;`"password": "password123",` <-- change to your MQTT server User Password
* &nbsp;&nbsp;`"publishTopic": "pool",` <-- Desired MQTT base topic, "pool" typically is sufficient
* &nbsp;&nbsp;`"publishRetain": "true",` <-- Set to true or false depending on your need
* `},`
* &nbsp;&nbsp;`"njspc": {`
* &nbsp;&nbsp;`"ip": "127.0.0.1",` <-- change to your nodejs-poolcontroller IP
* &nbsp;&nbsp;`"port": "4200",` <-- change to your nodejs-poolcontroller Port (normally 4200)
* `{`

7. Run the app with `npm start`.
   * `npm start` - You should use this every time you download/clone/pull the latest code.
   * `npm run start:cached` - Will run the app without compiling the code which can be much faster.
8. At this point you should see some console logs from njspc-mqtt-broker. If you see something similar to the below, then all is good.  
__2020-08-19 21:58:44 MQTT: OK (Publish) Topic:pool/circuits/5/spalight/state Message:on__

**Tip:** Use an MQTT tool such as [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com) to validate your MQTT messages look proper!

## Automate startup of app
- Todo using PM2

# Home Automation Usage
Ok, so now you have the following up and running.
- An MQTT server
- nodejs-poolcontroller v6.X
- njspc-mqtt-broker installed and running, and communicating to both your MQTT Server and nodejs-poolcontroller installation
- A Home Automation Platform that supports MQTT such as Home Assistant

njspc-mqtt-broker upon application startup will gather pool equipment element sensor and state information. Pool equipment element Name and ID metadata as defined in your pool controller will be used to create the topics. For example:

**Example 1:** Pool Controller Circuit/Relay 1 is configured to turn on/off the Pool Pump. You named it "Pool" during its configuration. The MQTT topic dynamically built will be: `pool/circuits/1/pool/state`.

**Example 2:** Pool Controller Circuit/Relay 5 is configured to turn on/off your IntelliBright LED Spa light. You named it "Spa Light" during its configuration. The MQTT topic dynamically built will be: `pool/circuits/5/spalight/state`

**Example 3:** Pool Controller Feature is configured for a water feature to turn on/off a booster pump and your pool controller placed this on internal feature id 129 and you named it "Water Scuppers" during its configuration. The MQTT topic dynamically built will be: `pool/features/129/waterscuppers/state`

**Note:** njspc-mqtt-broker will convert all pool equipment element names to lowercase and remove spaces and "/" characters.  

When njspc-mqtt-broker has been successfully started, it will log the output to the console. **You will need to note this information to determine your discovered pool equipment elements and dynamically built MQTT topics.**  

### Example njspc-mqtt-broker Log Output

### Home Assistant Configuration Example for a Circuit or Feature
- Configured as a switch
- State topics end with **/state** and are __read-write__
- States can only be changed by publishing an **on** or **off** message to /set. Example: pool/circuits/6/pool/state/**set** (see below HA configuration example)

**Configuration.yaml**  

`- switch:`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`- platform: mqtt`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`name: Pool`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`icon: mdi:pool`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`state_topic: "pool/circuits/1/pool/state"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`command_topic: 'pool/circuits/1/pool/state/set'`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`payload_on: "on"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`payload_off: "off"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`optimistic: false`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`retain: false`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`qos: 0`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`- platform: mqtt`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`name: Spa Light`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`icon: mdi:car-light-dimmed`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`state_topic: "pool/circuits/5/spalight/state"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`command_topic: 'pool/circuits/5/spalight/state/set'`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`payload_on: "on"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`payload_off: "off"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`optimistic: false`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`retain: false`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`qos: 0`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`- platform: mqtt`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`name: Water Scuppers`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`icon: mdi:water`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`state_topic: "pool/features/129/waterscuppers/state"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`command_topic: 'pool/features/129/waterscuppers/state/set'`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`payload_on: "on"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`payload_off: "off"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`optimistic: false`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`retain: false`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`qos: 0`  

### Home Assistant Configuration Example for a Sensor
- Configured as a sensor
- Sensor topics end with **/sensor** and are __read-only__
- Sensors can be used for information purposed only. Such as IF pool water temp >= 90, AND time of day is 11am to 5pm, THEN turn on water feature.

`- template:`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`- sensors:`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`- platform: mqtt`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`name: "Pool Water Temp"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`state_topic: "pool/temps/watersensor1/sensor"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`unit_of_measurement: 'Â°F'`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`value_template: "{{ value_json }}"`
